# An API for a Task Volunteering Platform

## Background: 
I built this API during a hackathon for a platform where volunteers can sign up to help elderly and people in risk groups with everyday tasks. 

## Frameworks/tech: 
The API is built using Node and Express. The data is stored in MongoDB and Mongoose is used as an ORM to model the data. 

## Usage: 
Simply run `npm install`, fill in the blank fields in [config/dev.env](config/dev.env) and run `npm start dev` (requires a MongoDB database, either running locally or on a public URL).
